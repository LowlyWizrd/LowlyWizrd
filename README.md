- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LowlyWizrd. I'm an Australian physicist hoping to move onto my PhD. This place will hopefully serve as a place to put all my code--most of which is just going to be physics simulations I did during undergrad.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in game/software development. At the moment I know some C, C++, C# but don't really have anything to show for it seeing as I'm primarily self-taught.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unity game development. Just making small projects and ripping off established ideas to learn from them.
